In terms of labor division, Rachel wrote the classes that involved making the actual GUI. These classes included: WellesleyMapGUI, IntroTab, FindPathTab, and CreatorsTab. Sheree worked on the getShortestPath method--specifically the Dijkstra’s algorithm--inside of the WellesleyMap class, and Michelle wrote the helper methods for getShortestPath, which include getSuccessors, findMin, length, and getIndex. A few times, Sheree and Michelle worked together on the getShortestPath code (sitting side by side, with Sheree typing), since it is one of the most complex and difficult code in our project. All three of us, Rachel, Michelle, and Sheree, reviewed each other’s code and made sure it was implemented correctly and tested thoroughly.
